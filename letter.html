                    Happy (very belated) birthday, my love! I know, I know—three weeks is a long time for a late greeting through a letter, but hear me out. I didn't forget, I just wanted to take my time to write you something truly meaningful. Birthdays are special, and even though this letter might be late, my love and appreciation for you are as strong as ever. Besides, you deserve to be celebrated not just on your birthday, but every single day of the year.
                </p>

                    As I write this letter, I can't help but reflect on how we've been through so much together in the past (almost) three years. From balancing the craziness of work and academics to navigating the ups and downs of our relationship, it hasn't always been easy. There were moments where everything felt overwhelming, when we struggled to find the balance between our lives and our responsibilities. And let's be honest, we've had our fair share of disagreements and disputes. But through it all, we've chosen each other, time and time again. We've worked through every misunderstanding, every challenge, and every late-night conversation that started out tough but ended with us holding on tighter than ever. That's something I'm incredibly proud of and endlessly grateful for. You've taught me the power of communication and love that doesn't waver in the hardest of times.
                </p>

                    As the break approaches, I find myself already missing you. The thought of not seeing you as often, of not having you by my side during the little moments that make up my day, is honestly harder than I'd like to admit. But I'll carry you with me in my thoughts and heart, no matter where I am. And Korea? Don't worry. You'll be on my mind the whole time, and I promise to get you something cool there hehehe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You mean the world to me, bubba. Thank you for being patient with me, for loving me through my flaws, and for sticking with me through the chaos of life. You're my partner, my bestest friend, and the one I look forward to sharing every milestone with. Here's to more adventures, silly moments, and more love than we can ever imagine. I'm so lucky to have you in my life, and I promise to show you just how much you mean to me—not just on your birthday, but always.
